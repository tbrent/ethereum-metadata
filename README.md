# Metadata Receiver

This project describes a very simple smart contract for emitting arbitrary bytes. The idea is to use this smart contract as the recipient of a second tx that is batched together with an ERC20 transfer using Gnosis Safe transaction builder, as an easy hack for attachinig metadata to an ERC20 transfer.
